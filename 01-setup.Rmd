# Setup {#setup}

Our very first step is to download and install R. The sequence below is current as of August 2021. CRAN, which is an open repository for R content, hosts installation files for R across different servers located around the world. I am based out of the US so I will pick one from here but you could literally use any of the options here to download R.  On the next screen, pick the version of R that corresponds to your operating system and install it on your machine.
